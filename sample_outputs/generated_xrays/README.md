# Generated X-Ray Samples

This folder contains sample synthetic chest X-ray images generated by our GAN models.

## Contents

- `dcgan_samples/` - Samples from DCGAN (64×64)
- `wgan_samples/` - Samples from WGAN-GP (256×256)
- `best_samples/` - Curated high-quality samples

## Image Quality

The WGAN-GP model produces significantly higher quality images with better:
- Anatomical structure preservation
- Texture realism
- Edge definition
- Overall visual fidelity

## Usage

These images can be used for:
1. Data augmentation in training pipelines
2. Visual comparison and evaluation
3. Demonstration purposes

**Note**: These are synthetic images and should not be used for clinical diagnosis.
