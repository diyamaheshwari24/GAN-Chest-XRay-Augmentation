# LLM-Generated Reports

This folder contains sample radiologist-style reports generated by our language model.

## Report Generation Methods

### 1. Falcon-7B-Instruct (LLM-based)
- Uses Falcon-7B language model fine-tuned for instructions
- Generates dynamic, contextual reports
- Requires GPU with 16GB+ VRAM

### 2. Template-based (Offline)
- Uses predefined clinical templates
- Works without GPU
- Consistent, structured output

## Report Structure

Each report contains:

1. **Condition**: NORMAL or PNEUMONIA
2. **Confidence**: Model prediction probability
3. **Severity**: mild/moderate/severe (based on confidence)
4. **Findings**: Clinical observations
5. **Possible Causes**: Potential diagnoses
6. **Impression**: Summary assessment
7. **Recommendation**: Suggested next steps
